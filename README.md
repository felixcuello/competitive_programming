# Competitive Programming

- **`books/`**: Is the directory to upload theory resources.
  
- **`code/`**: Is a directory to upload the code. The file names should be something like:
  - `<<initials>>_<<site>>_<<code>>.<<extension>>`, for exmaple if I solve the problem 100 in codeforces. It's going to be **`fc_cf_100.cpp`** so it's easy to compare problems between users.
  - Sites are going to be:
    - `cf`: Code Forces
    - `hr`: Hacker Rank
    - `lc`: Leet Code
